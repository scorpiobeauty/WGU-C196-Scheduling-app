# WGU-C196-Scheduling-app
Mobile Application Development – C196

REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The similarity report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide.

 You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).

Note: The assessment must be submitted in an Android Studio project using Java as the programming language. External plugins and libraries are not allowed in the project.

Note: Submit your performance assessment by including all Android project files, APK, and signed apk files in one zipped.zip file.

Note: The zip file submission must also keep the project file and folder structure intact for the Android Studio IDE.

a.  Add as many courses as needed

b.  Display a list of courses associated with each term

c.  Display a detailed view of the term title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2, Spring Term), the start date, and the end date for each term

5.  Include the following details for each course:

•  The course title

•  The start date

•  The end date

c.  Enter, edit, and delete course information.

d.  Display optional notes.

e.  Display a detailed view of the course, including the end date.

f.  Set alerts for the start and end date, that will trigger when the application is not running.

g.  Share notes via a sharing feature (either e-mail or SMS) that automatically populates with the notes.

7.  Include features that allow the user to do the following for each assessment:

a.  Add performance and objective assessments for each course, including the titles and end dates of the assessments.

b.  Enter, edit, and delete assessment information.

c.  Set alerts for start and end dates, that will trigger when the application is not running.
 

B.  Design the following screen layouts, including appropriate GUI (graphical user interface) elements (e.g., navigation, input, and information) for each layout:

•  home screen

•  list of terms

•  list of courses

•  list of assessments

•  detailed course view

•  detailed term view

•  detailed assessment view
 

C.  Implement a scheduler within your application from Part A and include the following elements:

•  an ArrayList

•  an intent

•  navigation capability between multiple screens using activity

•  three activities

•  events (e.g., a click event)

•  the ability to work in portrait and landscape layout

•  interactive capability (e.g., the ability to accept and act upon user input)

•  a database to store and retrieve application data

•  an application title and an icon

•  notifications or alerts

•  the use of both declarative and programmatic methods to create a user interface
 

1.  Include the following interface requirements in the application from part C:

•  the ability to scroll vertically

•  an action bar

•  two layouts

•  input controls

•  buttons
 

D.  Create a storyboard to demonstrate application flow that includes each of the menus and screens from part B.
 

E.  Provide screen shots of generating the signed APK to demonstrate that you have created a deployment package.
 

Note: Verify that all the required functions of your application are working by executing the apk file.
 

F.  Reflect on the creation of your mobile application by doing the following:

1.  Explain how your application would be different if it were developed for a tablet rather than a phone, including a discussion of fragments and layouts.

2.  Identify the minimum and target operating system your application was developed under and is compatible with.

3.  Describe (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) the challenges you faced during the development of the mobile application.

4.  Describe (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) how you overcame each challenge discussed in part F3.

5.  Discuss (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) what you would do differently if you did the project again.

6.  Describe how emulators are used and the pros and cons of using an emulator versus using a development device.
 

G.  Acknowledge sources, using APA-formatted in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
